# Movie Genre Classification

## Overview
This project aims to create a machine learning model that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. The model leverages techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## Data Collection
The dataset for this project includes movie plot summaries, titles, and genres. The data can be sourced from various movie databases like [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) and [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).

## Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps involve:
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Tokenization
- Removal of stop words
- Vectorization using TF-IDF or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)

## Model Development
The model development process involves:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model selection (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model training

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Usage
To use the model, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/movie-genre-classification.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the data preprocessing script: `python preprocess_data.py`
4. Train the model: `python train_model.py`
5. Make predictions: `python predict_genre.py --input <input_file>`
